All document types return the following metadata fields when the information is available from the source file:

Metadata field name	        Description
-----------------------     ----------------------------------------
filename	                Filename
file_directory	            File directory
last_modified	            Last modified Date
filetype	                File type
coordinates	                XY Bounding Box Coordinates. See notes below for further details about the bounding box.
parent_id	                Element Hierarchy. parent_id may be used to infer where an element resides within the overall hierarchy of a document. For instance, a NarrativeText element may have a Title element as a parent (a “sub-title”), which in turn may have another Title element as its parent (a “title”).
category_depth	            Element depth relative to other elements of the same category. Category depth is the depth of an element relative to other elements of the same category. It’s set by a document partitioner and enables the hierarchy post-processor to compute more accurate hierarchies. Category depth may be set using native document hierarchies, e.g. reflecting <H1>, <H2>, or <H3> tags within an HTML document or the indentation level of a bulleted list item in a Word document.
text_as_html	            HTML representation of extracted tables. Only applicable to table elements.
languages	                Document Languages. At document level or element level. List is ordered by probability of being the primary language of the text.
emphasized_text_contents	Emphasized text (bold or italic) in the original document.
emphasized_text_tags	    Tags on text that is emphasized in the original document.
is_continuation	            True if element is a continuation of a previous element. Only relevant for chunking, if an element was divided into two due to max_characters.
detection_class_prob	    Detection model class probabilities. From unstructured-inference, hi-res strategy.
